### These are my style settings for obsidian, a popular note-taking software I use. 


To use my settings, you must have the "minimal" theme installed in obsidian and the "style settings" plugin
Once these plugins are activated (Navigate to the "community plugins" tab in the settings), go to the "style settings" tab under "community plugins."
Click "Import" in the top-right corner of the box, and select the file you downloaded from this page.
